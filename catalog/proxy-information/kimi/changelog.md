# Kimi Code: Version history

Generated from the structured changelog, newest Proxy version first. Original publication and later repository distributions are recorded separately; missing historical details are not invented.

Release combination snapshot: Proxy **0.4.14**, Runtime **2.3.3**. These are distribution targets, not this machine's installed state.

## 0.4.14

First published: 2026-10-28T04:36:28Z (UTC).

- [RichToyo/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.14): 2026-10-28T04:36:28Z.
- CLI: 2.3.3 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Fix TodoList and plan-review A-B-A updates reusing an event identity and blocking subsequent output and turn completion. Preserve adjacent-plan suppression and native-event replay idempotency. Upgrade the managed Kimi Code Runtime to official 2.3.3 with pinned archive bytes. Exact artifacts pass hosted qualification; real account, Provider and Desktop acceptance are not claimed.

## 0.4.13

First published: 2026-10-27T13:43:37Z (UTC).

- [RichToyo/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.13): 2026-10-27T13:43:37Z.
- CLI: 2.3.2 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Add official-account quota inspection through the local Kimi server API. Record authoritative live cumulative usage without emitting placeholder session totals at finalization. Use Proxy Protocol SDK 1.0.4 and retain Kimi Code 2.3.2. Exact artifacts pass hosted qualification; real account, Provider and Desktop acceptance are not claimed.

## 0.4.12

First published: 2026-10-25T18:19:48Z (UTC).

- [RichToyo/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.12): 2026-10-25T18:19:48Z.
- CLI: 2.3.2 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Update the managed Kimi Code Runtime to official 2.3.2, matching the GitHub release asset digest. The 2.3.1-to-2.3.2 diff touches no kap-server file, so the transport/API is unchanged; shared agent-core tool-driven swarm entry is disabled until the user enables swarm mode (swarmService.enter("tool") throws, AgentSwarm resolve/execute return isError when inactive, transcript folding ignores tool-triggered activation), which can affect web-runtime behavior - this Proxy declares and enables no swarm policy and its generic isError/replay handling stays compatible. A bounded no-Provider native probe confirms 2.3.2 reports 2.3.2, serves the same 112 REST paths and the production token layout (raw evidence preserved). Exact artifacts pass hosted qualification; real Provider turns are not claimed.

## 0.4.11

First published: 2026-10-25T04:45:07Z (UTC).

- [RichToyo/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.11): 2026-10-25T04:45:07Z.
- CLI: 2.3.1 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Republish the Kimi Proxy at 0.4.11 with the shared security repair set: Proxy Protocol SDK 1.0.3 (zod exactly 4.6.6, wire unchanged), body-parser 2.4.0 and undici 8.12.2. The verified Kimi Code Runtime stays 2.3.1. Exact artifacts pass hosted qualification; real Provider turns are not claimed.

## 0.4.10

First published: 2026-10-23T19:02:25Z (UTC).

- [RichToyo/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.10): 2026-10-23T19:02:25Z.
- CLI: 2.3.1 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Update the managed Kimi Code Runtime to official 2.3.1, matching the GitHub release asset digest. The exact 2.3.0-to-2.3.1 kap-server source diff (rest-session, sessions, workspaces, openapi/transforms) shows an added optional session-takeover action this Proxy never calls and a workspace trust lookup now read directly from the trust store without instantiating a workspace; native session locks stay at their defaults. A live 2.3.1 native server probe (isolated HOME, production supervisor/token, no user locks, no Provider turn) confirms 112 REST paths with the only addition /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}:takeover and no removals. Exact artifacts pass hosted qualification; real Provider turns are not claimed. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.10) [Source 2](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-kimi-v0.4.10/packages/proxies/kimi-proxy/README.md)

## 0.4.9

First published: 2026-10-23T11:48:09Z (UTC).

- [RichToyo/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.9): 2026-10-23T11:48:09Z.
- CLI: 2.3.0 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Update the managed Kimi Code Runtime to official 2.3.0. Compare native OpenAPI and AsyncAPI surfaces against 2.2.0: existing methods and message types remain, with optional fields, new endpoints and session concurrency errors. Preserve native 40931 as SESSION_BUSY and 40932 as CONFLICT without automatic retry. Read the observed KIMI_CODE_HOME/server.token path without relying on a startup banner. Exact artifacts pass hosted qualification; real Provider turns are not claimed. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.9) [Source 2](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-kimi-v0.4.9/packages/proxies/kimi-proxy/README.md)

## 0.4.8

First published: 2026-10-21T12:23:22Z (UTC).

- [RichToyo/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.8): 2026-10-21T12:23:22Z.
- CLI: 2.2.0 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Publish an English-only Kimi Proxy from RichToyo. Retain Kimi Code Runtime 2.2.0 and the existing wire protocol. Exact artifacts pass hosted qualification; real Provider turns and App/Desktop acceptance are not claimed. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.8) [Source 2](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-kimi-v0.4.8/packages/proxies/kimi-proxy/README.md)

## 0.4.7

First published: 2026-10-15T10:55:26Z (UTC).

- [RichLogic/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.7): 2026-10-15T10:55:26Z.
- CLI: 2.2.0 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Update the Kimi Code Runtime to 2.2.0 (matching the official @moonshot-ai/kimi-code@2.2.0 GitHub asset digest). The published server-api reference diff from 2.1.1 to 2.2.0 is purely additive (Remote Control endpoints, optional fields), and a live 2.2.0 /openapi.json + /asyncapi.json probe confirmed every REST route and WebSocket message type this Proxy uses. The adapter and the wire protocol range are unchanged. Artifacts pass hosted qualification; real model turns were not run for this release. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.7) [Source 2](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-kimi-v0.4.7/packages/proxies/kimi-proxy/README.md)

## 0.4.6

First published: 2026-10-11T05:51:34Z (UTC).

- [RichLogic/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.6): 2026-10-11T05:51:34Z.
- CLI: 2.1.1 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Preserve and resume turns across Runtime disconnects: notification counters reset on a new stream binding and events resume from durable cursors, and only a child process exit is treated as runtime-down. Confirmation prompts explicitly declare the action that may omit answers. The standalone package uses public Proxy Protocol SDK 1.0.2; the wire protocol range and Kimi Code Runtime 2.1.1 remain unchanged. Real model turns were not run for this release. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.6) [Source 2](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-kimi-v0.4.6/packages/proxies/kimi-proxy/README.md)

## 0.4.5

First published: 2026-10-07T07:19:00Z (UTC).

- [RichLogic/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.5): 2026-10-07T07:19:00Z.
- CLI: 2.1.1 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Fix native cold-child Side Chat subscription and terminal handling, continuation after Stop, and tool/file-diff projection. Native Question cancellation explicitly declares the actions that may omit answers. The standalone package uses public Proxy Protocol SDK 1.0.2; the wire protocol range and Kimi Code Runtime 2.1.1 remain unchanged. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.5) [Source 2](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-kimi-v0.4.5/packages/proxies/kimi-proxy/README.md)

## 0.4.4

First published: 2026-09-30T08:50:47Z (UTC).

- [RichLogic/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.4): 2026-09-30T08:50:47Z.
- CLI: 2.1.1 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Project assistant text and thinking separately for each native step, preserve command, file and search tool-result presentation, and fix volatile frames that reuse the durable sequence and usage event identities. Idle sessions after a completed turn support fork and side chat; forking at a specific turn remains unavailable. The Proxy wire protocol and Kimi Code 2.1.1 Runtime pin are unchanged. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.4) [Source 2](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-kimi-v0.4.4/packages/proxies/kimi-proxy/README.md)

## 0.4.3

First published: 2026-09-28T15:28:15Z (UTC).

- [RichLogic/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.3): 2026-09-28T15:28:15Z.
- CLI: 2.1.1 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Keep previously returned Catalog revisions valid while the Kimi model catalog is unchanged, so switching models can refresh the available reasoning efforts without rejecting a still-valid revision. A changed model catalog requires a new catalog.list. This release does not change the Proxy wire protocol or the Kimi Code 2.1.1 Runtime pin. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.3) [Source 2](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-kimi-v0.4.3/packages/proxies/kimi-proxy/README.md)

- CLI: 2.1.1 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Re-issued at 0.4.2: the capability surface is identical to 0.4.1 (Kimi Code 2.1.1 local Server API); version identifiers only, no functional changes. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.2) [Source 2](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-kimi-v0.4.2/packages/proxies/kimi-proxy/README.md)

- CLI: 2.1.1 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Use the Kimi Code 2.1.1 local Server API for native session management, steer, structured interactions, and plan and diff events, retiring the ACP child. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.4.1) [Source 2](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-kimi-v0.4.1/packages/proxies/kimi-proxy/README.md)

## 0.3.3

First published: 2026-09-24T09:39:35Z (UTC).

- CLI: 2.1.0 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Fixed

- Support Kimi Code 2.1.0, correct model-dependent thinking choices and replay turn identities, and stop advertising unsupported native rename. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.3.3) [Source 2](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/blob/4740fab7dc3370cc812984519b5e9509bbcad2c0/CHANGELOG.md)

## 0.3.2

First published: 2026-09-20T09:48:27Z (UTC).

- [RichLogic/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.3.2): 2026-09-20T09:48:27Z.
- CLI: 0.41.0, 2.0.0 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Stop rejecting sessions solely on the old session-store minimum version. Restoration failures remain diagnosable; compatibility with all older history is not claimed. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-kimi-v0.3.2/packages/proxies/kimi-proxy/src/runtime/session-store.ts)

### Fixed

- Bound waiting for Session-level ACP requests and handle invalid native attach bindings. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-kimi-v0.3.2/packages/proxies/kimi-proxy/src/runtime/kimi-acp-client.ts)
- Do not carry the legacy role field into new Turn configuration options. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-kimi-v0.3.2/packages/proxies/kimi-proxy/src/protocol/v2-adapter.ts)

### Notes

- The Manifest declares 0.41.0 and 2.0.0; Catalog 1.7.0 selects 2.0.0. Compatibility declarations do not describe the currently installed version. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/catalog-v1.7.0)
- Distributed from Gian-Proxies on 2026-09-20. This records a distribution source and artifact, not a separate Proxy version. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-kimi-v0.3.2)
