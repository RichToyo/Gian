# Codex: Version history

Generated from the structured changelog, newest Proxy version first. Original publication and later repository distributions are recorded separately; missing historical details are not invented.

Release combination snapshot: Proxy **0.3.7**, Runtime **0.163.0**. These are distribution targets, not this machine's installed state.

## 0.3.7

First published: 2026-10-21T12:23:19Z (UTC).

- [RichToyo/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-codex-v0.3.7): 2026-10-21T12:23:19Z.
- CLI: 0.163.0 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Publish an English-only Codex Proxy from RichToyo, including the managed gian-session Skill. Retain Codex CLI 0.163.0 and the existing wire protocol. Exact artifacts pass hosted qualification; real Provider turns and App/Desktop acceptance are not claimed.

## 0.3.6

First published: 2026-10-16T18:19:57Z (UTC).

- [RichLogic/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-codex-v0.3.6): 2026-10-16T18:19:57Z.
- CLI: 0.163.0 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Update the managed Codex CLI to 0.163.0 (first stable of the 0.163 line, published 2026-10-15; matching the official rust-v0.163.0 GitHub asset digest). Exact old/new app-server schema comparison shows additive-only changes across every Proxy-used protocol surface (optional fields, new read-state notifications), a byte-identical ServerRequest, and no removed or changed method the Proxy calls (unrelated realtime voice enums also changed; the Proxy does not use them); no-credential initialize handshakes are identical on 0.162.1 and 0.163.0. The wire contract is unchanged. Artifacts pass hosted qualification; real model turns were not run for this release.

- CLI: 0.162.1 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Update the managed Codex CLI to 0.162.1 (matching the official rust-v0.162.1 GitHub asset digest). Upstream 0.162.x changes are additive for the app-server surface; the adapter and the gian.proxy wire contract are unchanged. Artifacts pass hosted qualification; real model turns were not run for this release.

- [RichLogic/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-codex-v0.3.4): 2026-10-11T05:51:31Z.
- CLI: 0.161.0 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Update the managed Codex CLI to 0.161.0; long native histories page through disk with stable Fork ancestry and event identity, and the Proxy reports its real package version to the Runtime. The app-server bridge and gian.proxy wire contract are unchanged. Real model turns were not run for this release.

- CLI: 0.159.2 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Update the managed Codex CLI to 0.159.2 without changing the Proxy app-server bridge or gian.proxy wire contract. Real model turns were not run for this release. [Source 1](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-codex-v0.3.3) [Source 2](https://github.com/RichLogic/Gian-Proxies/blob/proxy-codex-v0.3.3/packages/proxies/codex-proxy/README.md)
