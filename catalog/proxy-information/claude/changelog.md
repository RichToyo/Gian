# Claude Code: Version history

Generated from the structured changelog, newest Proxy version first. Original publication and later repository distributions are recorded separately; missing historical details are not invented.

Release combination snapshot: Proxy **0.3.14**, Runtime **2.1.310**. These are distribution targets, not this machine's installed state.

## 0.3.14

First published: 2026-10-25T04:45:01Z (UTC).

- [RichToyo/Gian-Proxies distribution](https://github.com/RichToyo/Gian-Proxies/releases/tag/proxy-claude-v0.3.14): 2026-10-25T04:45:01Z.
- CLI: 2.1.310 (Manifest compatibility declaration, not local installation state).

### Changed

- Update the managed Claude Code Runtime to official 2.1.310 (GitHub latest v2.1.310 and npm latest; the vendor /stable pointer still reads 2.1.308, recorded as a lagging rolling pointer, not prerelease evidence). Match the official manifest SHA-256 and size and verify the nine selected startup flags. Retain MCP SDK 1.32.0 and bounded HTTP input. The 2.1.310 changelog review found no documented headless spawn/wire compatibility changes. Exact artifacts pass hosted qualification; authenticated Provider turns and App/Desktop acceptance are not claimed.
